* Tagging *
Once a new version has been packaged and uploaded, it is a good habit to tag the corresponding commit in the master branch of the git tracking system with the version number. This is done with a command similar to the following:

    git tag 0.1.5 5de1c07841e82b62cdd908e1910119fa9e22933c


* PyPI *
To build and upload the gMiner pacakge to the python package index you just need to change directory to the place where the setup.py script is found and run the following command:

    python setup.py sdist upload


* Graphs *
To run the automated graph tests, you can simply enter ipython and type the two following commands:

    [1] import gMiner.operations.desc_stat.graphs_tests as g
    [2] g.run()


* Version *
The version number needs to be incremented in the following files:

/setup.py
/gMiner/constants.py
/CHANGES.txt
/Documentation/
